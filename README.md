# Stratifi â€“ Personal Portfolio Tracker

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm working on building a new finance web app: a **personal portfolio tracker** that finally makes it easy to track all your investments in one place â€“ even if they're spread across different platforms.

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This

Most existing tools like **PDT**, **AllInvestView**, or **portfolio-info** are:

- Expensive  
- Overly complex  
- Require manual data formatting  
- Lack support for certain fund types (e.g. NT funds)

So I set out to build something better:

> A **FREE**, **frictionless portfolio tracker** where you can add all stocks and funds that are available.

You can:

- **Host your own server or local instance** via [GitHub](https://github.com/stratifitracker/stratifi)
- Or use the **hosted version** at [https://www.stratifi.eu/](https://www.stratifi.eu/)

## ðŸš€ Current Status

The app is in **V1 testing phase**, and Iâ€™m looking for enthusiastic users who:

âœ… Want to share their thoughts on which features are missing in current tools  
âœ… Are open to giving feedback on what's already working  
âœ… Would love **free early access** to a tool weâ€™re building together

Whether you're just getting started with investing or have been doing it for years â€“ your input is **super valuable**!
