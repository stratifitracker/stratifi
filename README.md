Hey everyone!
I'm working on building a new finance web app: a personal portfolio tracker that finally makes it easy to track all your investments in one place â€“ even if they're spread across different platforms.
Why I decided to build this app:
Tools like PDT or AllInvestView or portfolio-info are either expensive, complex, demand hard data formatting, or dont have fund data for NT funds i.e. 
My goal was to build a  FREE friction-less portfolio tracker where you can add all stocks and funds that are available. You can host your own server / local instance ( https://github.com/stratifitracker/stratifi ) or feel free to use the hosted website: https://www.stratifi.eu/ 
The app is currently in the V1 phase, and Iâ€™m looking for enthusiastic users who:
âœ… want to share their thoughts on which features they miss in current tools
âœ… are open to giving feedback on what's already working
âœ… would love free early access to a tool weâ€™re improving together ðŸ’¡
Whether you're just getting started with investing or have been doing it for years â€“ your input is super valuable!
ðŸ‘‰ Sounds interesting? Drop a comment or send me a DM!
